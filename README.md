# Self-similar composition
Algorithm for arranging samples based on similarity.

That is, provided a sample bank and a seed sample, the algorithm picks similar samples from the bank, so as to create a coherent audio track.

The algorithm could work with any sample bank. The code provides means of creating an FM Synthesis bank.
