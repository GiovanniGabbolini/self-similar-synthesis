# Self-similar synthesis
Algorithm for generating audio tracks based on similarity.

## Method
Provided a sample bank and a seed sample, the algorithm picks similar samples from the bank, so as to create a coherent audio track.

The algorithm could work with any sample bank. The code provides means of creating an FM Synthesis bank.

## Performance
Avalon Cafe, London, July 15th 2024: I sat in meditation as a generated track was played, in an effort of making peace with algorithms.
